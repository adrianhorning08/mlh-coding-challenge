Covert this design into a webpage

![alt text](/mockup.png)

## Implementation
* Created the HTML structure. The red area I called a header. The user profile and about me are a section called `user-profile-container`
* To get the user profile section to overlap with the header I used a negative margin for the top of the `user-profile-container`
* The social profile names and the list of skills are list items

## FYI's
* I don't have Sketch so couldn't access that folder (if there were any assets there)
* The picture dimensions I used look a little narrower than the one was used in the example
* I wasn't sure what font to use, so got one from google fonts that looked pretty close (Source Sans Pro)
* Didn't have access to the briefcase icon (if there was one available), so used an icon from Font Awesome
